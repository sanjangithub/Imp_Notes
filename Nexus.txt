For Nexus repository to use in your local : 
--------------------------------------------

1. First we need to connect with the server. This can be done by going to the Nexus.exe file which will be in the bin file.
									   ---------			       --- 

2. The above step can be done only when you run the command prompt as administrator.

3. Then run Nexus.exe /run --> This will start the server and when we hit localhost:8081 this will get connected to our server which is running in the cmd(Which we have run as the administrator).

4. Then we won't able to type anything in the cmd. If you need to type any command or stop the server, We can use the below command.
   
   ctrl + c --> This will allow us to type again or sometimes it will shutdown the server.
   Nexus.exe /stop --> Used to stop the server(Another method for stopping the server).
   Nexus.exe /install "Nexus-Repository-Service" --> Used to install the service once again in your local(If you loose everything, Remember to use this command. This is the starting process).
