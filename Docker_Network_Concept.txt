Networking:  Communication between one or more devices or here in docker we can say containers, then that communication is called "Networking".


There are 3 types of networks available in docker.

1. Bridge:
----------

* This is the default network assigned to the containers if we do not specify the type.
* Docker has docker0. This docker0 is the one that gives the IP address to the containers in the host (like 172.0.12.2, 172.0.12.3 etc).
* There is no direct connection between the containers. That communication happens through the docker0.
 
  eg: container1 wants to communicate with container2, then the request will go to docker0 and docker0 sends the message to container2.
 
* So no direct connection to the containers. So, the containers are connected internally and isolated.
* This is moderate in security.



2. Host:
--------

* We need to specify while creating the network like --type=host.
* We can access our app with the host ip address. There are no ip address for the container. Only the host IP address is used.
* Due to that, only one container is attached or port forwarded to this host IP.
* It's less secure as we are directly accessing it with the host IP.



3. None:
--------

* Complete isolation of the containers.
* We can use this when there is no need for communication for the containers.
* Highly secure. Because there are no network connections.
